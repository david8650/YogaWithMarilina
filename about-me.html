          I have always been a traveller and a seeker, my life adventure brought me to this beautiful corner of Portugal
          5
          years ago and I have never left since.

          I see life as a never ending cycle and yoga helps me find the connection with myself, my body and my mind
          again
          and again.

          Passionate about continuously learning, creativity is what fuels me. The more I explore and learn, the more I
          am
          able to share.

          My goal is to bring the ancient wisdom of Yoga into a modern tangible language that everyone can access and
          embody within their lives to gain a better state of mind & body well-being.

          I seek for others to thrive in life by nurturing their body, mind and soul.

          When you align your mind and your heart that’s when the magic happens.

          I truly deeply love nature and animals and I am determined to do what is in my hands to save this beautiful
          planet of ours. What we do in our day to day life, all our choices, impact us more than we are aware of.
          The ocean, the endless fields and the dramatic coastline of this place that I now call home stole my heart the
          very first day I put foot in the Algarve.
          If you come to Portugal, you will very possibly find me outside, either in the water surfing or hiking with my
          dog along the west coast of Portugal staring at the stunning nature around me.

          Living by the ocean is essential for me. I started to learn surfing when I arrived in Portugal and I have kept
          going in the water almost everyday since then. I can’t get enough of the sensation of freedom and happiness
          that
          the ocean brings me.
          It was written in the pages of my life I guess, the sea has always called me and put a smile on my face.

          I once had a corporate job that wasn’t my cup of tea but gave me the chance to travel around the globe and
          access all the yoga trainings and workshops I wanted to enrol.
          Yoga changed my life, it showed me that creating a life you want is possible, you just need the right mindset
          and will to actually make a change.

          <span class="strong">A rich lineage</span>
          I completed my Foundation Course with the Devon School of Yoga and my 200h Teacher Training with Yoga Campus in
          London. I have attended tons of workshops during my career - it would be very boring for you to read them all
          here.
          I will always be immensely grateful to the very knowledgeable teachers I had the opportunity to study with:
          Duncan Hulin, Sarah Litton, Max Strom, Zephyr Wildman and Bonnie Weeks. They all inspire me to deepen my studies
          and each one of them introduced me to different aspects of the yoga world that now adds an expertise to my
          teaching.
